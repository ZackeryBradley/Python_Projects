#numpy examples

#example: calculating total revenue
prices = np.array([19.99, 29.99, 14.99, 9.99, 24.99])
prices

quantities = np.array([10, 5, 8, 12, 3])
quantities

#multipying price * quanity to get revenue per product
revenue_per_product = prices * quantities

#adding the sum of the multiplications of price and quantity to get total revenue
total_revenue = np.sum(revenue_per_product)
print("Total revenue:", total_revenue)
# Total revenue: 664.62

#calculating revenue per product

#example 2: analyzing blog post statistics

views = np.array([1000, 500, 800, 1200, 300, 600])
views

#finding the maximum view amongst the entire array
max_views = np.max(views)
max_views

#finding the minimum views amongst the entire array 
min_views = np.min(views)
min_views

#average views amongst the entire array and rounding it to 2 decimal places
average_views = np.round(np.mean(views),2)
average_views

#using sum to get the total views within the array
total_views = np.sum(views)
total_views
